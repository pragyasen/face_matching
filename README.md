# face_matching
Our approach to designing an efficient face searching algorithm involves three main components: 
(1) face detection and feature extraction: MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks), InceptionResnetV1
(2) efficient indexing and similarity search: Facebook Faiss Vector Database
(3) dynamic matching thresholds to enhance robustness and scalability
